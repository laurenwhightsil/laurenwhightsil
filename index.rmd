  # Hi, I'm Lauren Whightsil.
</center>

I am an undergraduate student at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), pursuing a B.A. in Geography and emphasis in G.I.S. I am currently interning as a Mapping GIS Analyst for UCSB's Environmental Health & Safety. During my free time, I enjoy rollerskating, exploring the outdoors, reading, and listening to podcasts, such as [The MapScaping Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/57EmXdDgrUNYxtrer6LVsI?si=ANefhTBbR6Ceo01_TkV4_w&dl_branch=1). In my time remaining at UCSB, I look forward to learning more about spatial data science, programming, and GIS.
