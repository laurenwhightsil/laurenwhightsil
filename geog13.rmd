In the summer of 2021, I took a spatial data science course based in R. It introduced me to programming and how to write code. Here is a collection of links showcasing what I learned!

## [Building a project website]()

- In this assignment, I built a static user site with Github Pages.
- The code and files for this site are stored and organized in a Github repository.
- Toolkits, such as Bootstrap, enable navigation by redirecting one from the home page to other pages via the navbar.
- I used [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/3/) to add a theme to my website.
